This script prompts the user to enter the file path, reads the content of the file, and uses regular expressions to search for sensitive data such as credit card numbers, email addresses, and social security numbers. 
If sensitive data is found, the user is asked if they want to redact it and replace it with asterisks.
The redacted file is then saved back to the original location.
